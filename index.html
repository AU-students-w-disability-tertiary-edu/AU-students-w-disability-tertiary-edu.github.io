		<h2>Disability and doing Tertiary Education</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<div>
				Tertiary Education can be difficult with a Disability.</br></br>
				
				I've setup this website because there isn't any place online for students with a Disability.</br></br>
				
				If you have any advice that you want to share with people with a Disability, please contact me</br></br>
				
				Also I have a question I want to raise with people. If you had gaps of time in study due to Disability playing up;
				if you had the financial ability to do so; would you like to be able to get some sort of assessment to find out what you remember of previous study?
				Would you like to have someone organise it for you, in case you were distressed? </br></br>
				
				Seems like currently there's no way to get any such assessment if you are distressed. </br></br>
				
				Federal Government funding only goes towards help for currently enrolled courses.
